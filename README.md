This site, www.justinehodgsonhypnotherapy.com, was developed for my partner. She coincidentally qualified as a Curative Hypnotherapist and needed to have her website built.
This was excellent timing as I could use the idea and requirements of the site for my first milestone project!<br><br>

Justine wanted a site that was reflective of her as an individual and her identity as a hypnotherapist. As she is just launching her professional seevices, it was thought to be 
advantageous to start with a reasonably basic structure and offer several features. The main ideal for this site was to reach out and provide a bridge of trust, understanding and 
comfort to prospective clients. Trust within Justine as a person and Hypnotherapist as well as educate the potential client as to what Hypnotherapy is and how it works. Lastly, provide
the means for clients to reach out to Justine and communicate with her and understand the process that they could potentially go through with Justine as their Hypnotherapist.

## UX

### Project Purpose

The main goal of this project was to provide a unique and personally reflective website for my partner for her newly establishing business as a Hyponotherapist.

The site would provide the neccesary and required information within an intuitive way and both inform and educate prospective clients of the services offered.

### User Experience

It was the stand point of Justine that potential clients/users of the web site of Justine Hodgson Curative Hypnotherpy (JHCH) would come from three potential backgrounds. 
Firstly, that of someone who has never experienced or engaged within Curative Hypnotherapy (CH), secondly, the user has used or engaged within Hypnotherapy before and 
are in the process of seeking this treatment again possibly with Justine. Lastly, the user/client could potentially be gathering information about the subject and/or Justine herself for themselves
or someone they know who may require possible treatment.

The essence and nature of this form of treatment and service provided is evidently very 'intimate' and as such, requires a high degree of trust, understanding, compassion, empathy, reliability and 
excellent communication. Indeed, the website for JHCH was viewed as an opportunity to bridge these very important and unique aspects of this type of service. The following points were established as
priorities for Justine for the user experience:

   - To allow the user to get to know who Justine is, her background and why she became a Hypnotherapist. This was very important so as to establish a bridge of trust between the user
     and Justine, the Hypnotherapist
   - To understand what Curative Hypnotherapy is, how it works and what is can be used for. Ultimately, provide information within a succint and informative manner that a potential user would possibly require.
   - Provide a realistic viewpoint of what Hypnotherapy can and cannot do. This was an opportunity to challenge popoular and sensationalist views associated with this therapy. 
   - Due to the nature of this treatment, it was important to encouarge and congratulate potential users. It is very normal that potential users would be fearful about disclosing their conditions
     and/or seeking professional help with these intimate and very personal conditions. A fine balance of 'enough' information versus 'too much' information was a very weighted and important factor.
   - Allow and provide the user to gain insight and information of the stages of therapy if they were to use the services offered by JHCH
   - Allow and provide the user several easy ways to make direct contact weith JHCH

The essence of hypnotherapy is to relax the user and provide a seemless service.
