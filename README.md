This site, www.justinehodgsonhypnotherapy.com, was developed for my partner. She coincidentally qualified as a Curative Hypnotherapist and needed to have her website built.
This was excellent timing as I could use the idea and requirements of the site for my first milestone project!<br><br>

Justine wanted a site that was reflective of her as an individual and her identity as a hypnotherapist. As she is just launching her professional seevices, it was thought to be 
advantageous to start with a reasonably basic structure and offer several features. The main ideal for this site was to reach out and provide a bridge of trust, understanding and 
comfort to prospective clients. Trust within Justine as a person and Hypnotherapist as well as educate the potential client as to what Hypnotherapy is and how it works. Lastly, provide
the means for clients to reach out to Justine and communicate with her and understand the process that they could potentially go through with Justine as their Hypnotherapist.

## UX

### Project Purpose

The main goal of this project was to provide a unique and personally reflective website for my partner for her newly establishing business as a Hyponotherapist.

The site would provide the neccesary and required information within an intuitive way and both inform and educate prospective clients of the services offered.

### User Experience & User Stories

It was the stand point of Justine that potential clients/users of the web site of Justine Hodgson Curative Hypnotherpy (JHCH) would come from three potential backgrounds. 
Firstly, that of someone who has never experienced or engaged within Curative Hypnotherapy (CH), secondly, the user has used or engaged within Hypnotherapy before and 
are in the process of seeking this treatment again possibly with Justine. Lastly, the user/client could potentially be gathering information about the subject and/or Justine herself for themselves
or someone they know who may require possible treatment.

The essence and nature of this form of treatment and service provided is evidently very 'intimate' and as such, requires a high degree of trust, understanding, compassion, empathy, reliability and 
excellent communication. Indeed, the website for JHCH was viewed as an opportunity to bridge these very important and unique aspects of this type of service. The following points were established as
priorities and goals for the user experience of her site:

   - To allow the user to get to know who Justine is, her background and why she became a Hypnotherapist. This was very important so as to establish a bridge of trust between the user
     and Justine, the Hypnotherapist. This, provide an opportunity to listen to Justine, her story and provide a real-life case study of a patient
   - To understand what Curative Hypnotherapy is, how it works and what is can be used for. Ultimately, provide information within a succint and informative manner that a potential user would possibly require.
   - Provide a realistic viewpoint of what Hypnotherapy can and cannot do. This was an opportunity to challenge popoular and sensationalist views associated with this therapy. 
   - Due to the nature of this treatment, it was important to encouarge and congratulate potential users. It is very normal that potential users would be fearful about disclosing their conditions
     and/or seeking professional help with these intimate and very personal conditions. A fine balance of 'enough' information versus 'too much' information was a very weighted and important factor.
   - Allow and provide the user to gain insight and information of the stages of therapy if they were to use the services offered by JHCH
   - Allow and provide the user several easy ways to make direct contact weith JHCH

The essence of hypnotherapy is to relax the user and provide a gentle, supportive and almost intuitive approach that is holistic and organic in nature. It was important to reflect this within the 
structure and design of the site. It has been attempted to reflect this in the look, feel, movement, function and structure of the JHCH website.

### Design Ideas

Research was conducted reviewing several Hypnotherapist websites. It was felt that the vast majority of sites contained an excessive amount of information. Whilst this was all very interesting and important
it was very academic in nature and style, almost copied from a text book rather than specifically written in a 'non-academic' manner.

It was also found that virtually all sites failed to provide a professionally tailored 'intimate or soulful' level of understanding about the therapist themselves. It was deemed as being very clinical.

These two major issues are in fact, from the stand point of the Hypnotherapist-client relationship, extremely important. One of the main goals for Justine as the therapist is to provide and ensure complete and utter
professional confidence within her clients.

As such, the following factors were considered important when designing the JHCH website:

   - A different look and feel
   - Colourful
   - Artistic in style
   - Flow through the site and sections
   - Openness
   - Attraction rather than promotion

#### Artwork/Fonts/Colours

The artwork/logo used of a heart/angel wing-shape and style was designed by myself using Adobe Illustrator. The differing spirals were used to create the shape of the heart as the spiral shapes can be associated
with the idea of thought, which Hypnotherapy evidently revolves around. 

It was decided to use three differing colours, the main colour of purple being the most predominant. The rationale for this was taken from colour theory, that being the colour purple has associations to holistic 
therapies and mindfulness/spirituality. Areas that aligned very well with the essence of the services offered. A slightly off-white was used as well as a soothing grey colour that provides contrast.

The font used was taken from [**Google Fonts**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poiret+One), this was Poiret One. The reason for this was that it was considered to be gentle in appearance, inviting, clean and generally uplifting. It was felt that it reflected 
Justine herself very well and was considered appeasing to the eye from a visual standpoint. 

#### Background

The website has 4 main sections, these being;

   - The Landing/Welcome page
   - Get to know me 
   - Let's Explore
   - Connect and Work with me

It was decided to title the differing sections in this way as it felt more intuitive for the user and helped to make the sections, and the site in a wider context, more personalised for the user when considering Justine.

The titles also give a very definitive meaning or objective as to what each section delivers for the user.

A session of Hypnotherapy has many sections to it yet is delivered in a way that flows and feels natural. The client wouldn't neccesarily be aware of the academic sections of the Hypnotherapy session as these are 
constructed in a way by Justine that one section flows into another. Yet, a slight difference in language and objective is both implied and executed by the Hypnoitherapist.

This idea was taken and translated into the JHCH website. Once section flows into the other. It was felt the smooth transition and effect of **Parallax CSS** was employed and to great effect.

My primary understanding of this subject was gained from; [First useful reference of Parallax CSS](https://keithclark.co.uk/articles/pure-css-parallax-websites/)
To back this up I also used; [I also used W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/). As will be seen in the Let's Explore and Connect/Work with me section's of the site, due to the amount of information presented
it was felt that a background image/parallax effect would not be used as it created a very busy and al most confusing environment for the user. As such, these areas were kept simple with the colours shown.

To provide clarity and ease of use, Scrollspy was employed. This provides an efficient way to jump, if neccesary, from one section to anotherif the user so wishes. My understanding for this was taken from the Bootstrap official documentation;
[Bootstrap Scrollspy Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/scrollspy/)

Personal photography from Justine was used of her and audio files that were recorded of her speaking to the user were recorded by Justine and provided to myself for use on the website.

The 4 different sections were given diferrentiating background colours of a purple shade to white. Once again providing contrast for these sections and differentiating the areas and theme.

## Features

### Existing Features

1. #### Landing/Welcome page

   - When the user arrives at the site they will be greeted with the opaque spiral heart logo as the parallax background. [**animate.css**](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) was used to
   fade the company name and navbar onto the page within a smooth and graceful manner. The rationale for this was to have the user focus primarily and initially on the heart shape and then have their
   attention drawn to the name of JHCH and then the differing sections of the site.

   - As the user scrolls down they will get to see and meet Justine with a photo of her as well as a welcome audio message for her. The user is presented with Play, Pause, Reload and Stop. The message 
   is approximately 1min 20sec long. This was not found on any other site. It's a very interesting statement that Justine Hodgson proposes to the user by offering this. It allows the user to hear her words
   and her voice for the first time. The voice of the Hypnotherapist is fundemantally and incredibly important if success is to occur with the treatment and therapy. As such we felt it prudent to offer the
   and sincere message of welcome and, at the sametime and without placing any noticable burden on the user, they will ultimately decide if they are okay to work with Justine and ultimately, her voice.

   - There is also a written personal message to accompany this this.
