This site, www.justinehodgsonhypnotherapy.com, was developed for my partner. She coincidentally qualified as a Curative Hypnotherapist and needed to have her website built.
This was excellent timing as I could use the idea and requirements of the site for my first milestone project!<br><br>

Justine wanted a site that was reflective of her as an individual and her identity as a hypnotherapist. As she is just launching her professional seevices, it was thought to be 
advantageous to start with a reasonably basic structure and offer several features. The main ideal for this site was to reach out and provide a bridge of trust, understanding and 
comfort to prospective clients. Trust within Justine as a person and Hypnotherapist as well as educate the potential client as to what Hypnotherapy is and how it works. Lastly, provide
the means for clients to reach out to Justine and communicate with her and understand the process that they could potentially go through with Justine as their Hypnotherapist.
