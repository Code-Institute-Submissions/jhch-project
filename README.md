This site, www.justinehodgsonhypnotherapy.com, was developed for my partner. She coincidentally qualified as a Curative Hypnotherapist and needed to have her website built.
This was excellent timing as I could use the idea and requirements of the site for my first milestone project!<br><br>

Justine wanted a site that was reflective of her as an individual and her identity as a hypnotherapist. As she is just launching her professional services, it was thought to be 
advantageous to start with a reasonably basic structure and offer several features. The main idea for this site was to reach out and provide a bridge of trust, understanding and 
comfort to prospective clients. Trust within Justine as a person and Hypnotherapist as well as educate the potential client as to what Hypnotherapy is and how it works. Lastly, provide
the means for clients to reach out to Justine and communicate with her and understand the process that they could potentially go through with Justine as their Hypnotherapist.

## UX

### Project Purpose

The main goal of this project was to provide a unique and personally reflective website for my partner for her newly establishing business as a Hyponotherapist.

The site would provide the neccesary and required information within an intuitive way and both inform and educate prospective clients of the services offered.

### User Experience & User Stories

It was the stand point of Justine that potential clients/users of the web site of Justine Hodgson Curative Hypnotherpy (JHCH) would come from three potential backgrounds. 
Firstly, that of someone who has never experienced or engaged within Curative Hypnotherapy (CH), secondly, the user has used or engaged within Hypnotherapy before and 
are in the process of seeking this treatment again possibly with Justine. Lastly, the user/client could potentially be gathering information about the subject and/or Justine herself for themselves
or someone they know who may require possible treatment.

The essence and nature of this form of treatment and service provided is evidently very 'intimate' and as such, requires a high degree of trust, understanding, compassion, empathy, reliability and 
excellent communication. Indeed, the website for JHCH was viewed as an opportunity to bridge these very important and unique aspects of this type of service. The following points were established as
priorities and goals for the user experience of her site:

   - To allow the user to get to know who Justine is, her background and why she became a Hypnotherapist. This was very important so as to establish a bridge of trust between the user
     and Justine, the Hypnotherapist. This, provide an opportunity to listen to Justine, her story and provide a real-life case study of a patient
   - To understand what Curative Hypnotherapy is, how it works and what is can be used for. Ultimately, provide information within a succint and informative manner that a potential user would possibly require.
   - Provide a realistic viewpoint of what Hypnotherapy can and cannot do. This was an opportunity to challenge popoular and sensationalist views associated with this therapy. 
   - Due to the nature of this treatment, it was important to encouarge and congratulate potential users. It is very normal that potential users would be fearful about disclosing their conditions
     and/or seeking professional help with these intimate and very personal conditions. A fine balance of 'enough' information versus 'too much' information was a very weighted and important factor.
   - Allow and provide the user to gain insight and information of the stages of therapy if they were to use the services offered by JHCH
   - Allow and provide the user several easy ways to make direct contact with JHCH

The essence of hypnotherapy is to relax the user and provide a gentle, supportive and almost intuitive approach that is holistic and organic in nature. It was important to reflect this within the 
structure and design of the site. It has been attempted to reflect this in the look, feel, movement, function and structure of the JHCH website.

### Design Ideas

Research was conducted reviewing several Hypnotherapist websites. It was felt that the vast majority of sites contained an excessive amount of information. Whilst this was all very interesting and important
it was very academic in nature and style, almost copied from a text book rather than specifically written in a 'non-academic' manner.

It was also found that virtually all sites failed to provide a professionally tailored 'intimate or soulful' level of understanding about the therapist themselves. It was deemed as being very clinical.

These two major issues are in fact, from the stand point of the Hypnotherapist-client relationship, extremely important. One of the main goals for Justine as the therapist is to provide and ensure complete and utter
professional confidence within her clients.

As such, the following factors were considered important when designing the JHCH website:

   - A different look and feel
   - Colourful
   - Artistic in style
   - Flow through the site and sections
   - Openness
   - Attraction rather than promotion

#### Artwork/Fonts/Colours

The artwork/logo used of a heart/angel wing-shape and style was designed by myself using Adobe Illustrator. The differing spirals were used to create the shape of the heart as the spiral shapes can be associated
with the idea of thought, which Hypnotherapy evidently revolves around. 

It was decided to use three differing colours, the main colour of purple being the most predominant. The rationale for this was taken from colour theory, that being the colour purple has associations to holistic 
therapies and mindfulness/spirituality. Areas that aligned very well with the essence of the services offered. A slightly off-white was used as well as a soothing grey colour that provides contrast.

The font used was taken from [**Google Fonts**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poiret+One), this was Poiret One. The reason for this was that it was considered to be gentle in appearance, inviting, clean and generally uplifting. It was felt that it reflected 
Justine herself very well and was considered appeasing to the eye from a visual standpoint. 

#### Background

The website has 4 main sections, these being;

   - The Landing/Welcome page
   - Get to know me 
   - Let's Explore
   - Connect and Work with me
   - Blog

It was decided to title the differing sections in this way as it felt more intuitive for the user and helped to make the sections, and the site in a wider context, more personalised for the user when considering Justine.

The titles also give a very definitive meaning or objective as to what each section delivers for the user.

A session of Hypnotherapy has many sections to it yet is delivered in a way that flows and feels natural. The client wouldn't neccesarily be aware of the academic sections of the Hypnotherapy session as these are 
constructed in a way by Justine that one section flows into another. Yet, a slight difference in language and objective is both implied and executed by the Hypnoitherapist.

This idea was taken and translated into the JHCH website. Once section flows into the other. It was felt the smooth transition and effect of **Parallax CSS** was employed and to great effect.

My primary understanding of this subject was gained from; [First useful reference of Parallax CSS](https://keithclark.co.uk/articles/pure-css-parallax-websites/)
To back this up I also used; [I also used W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/). As will be seen in the Let's Explore and Connect/Work with me section's of the site, due to the amount of information presented
it was felt that a background image/parallax effect would not be used as it created a very busy and al most confusing environment for the user. As such, these areas were kept simple with the colours shown.

To provide clarity and ease of use, Scrollspy was employed. This provides an efficient way to jump, if neccesary, from one section to anotherif the user so wishes. My understanding for this was taken from the Bootstrap official documentation;
[Bootstrap Scrollspy Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/scrollspy/)

Personal photography from Justine was used of her and audio files that were recorded of her speaking to the user were recorded by Justine and provided to myself for use on the website.

The 4 different sections were given diferrentiating background colours of a purple shade to white. Once again providing contrast for these sections and differentiating the areas and theme. 

### Wireframes

The wireframes for this project were compiled using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) for a clean looking design layout.

## Features

### Existing Features

1. #### Landing/Welcome page

   - When the user arrives at the site they will be greeted with the opaque spiral heart logo as the parallax background. [**animate.css**](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) was used to
   fade the company name and navbar onto the page within a smooth and graceful manner. The rationale for this was to have the user focus primarily and initially on the heart shape and then have their
   attention drawn to the name of JHCH and then the differing sections of the site. There is also two specific links on the right-hand side of the page (Not XS or S) for Instagram and Justine's LinkedIn profile.

   - As the user scrolls down they will get to see and meet Justine with a photo of her as well as a welcome audio message for her. The user is presented with Play, Pause, Reload and Stop. The message 
   is approximately 1min 20sec long. This was not found on any other site. It's a very interesting statement that Justine Hodgson proposes to the user by offering this. It allows the user to hear her words
   and her voice for the first time. The voice of the Hypnotherapist is fundemantally and incredibly important if success is to occur with the treatment and therapy. As such we felt it prudent to offer the
   and sincere message of welcome and, at the sametime and without placing any noticable burden on the user, they will ultimately decide if they are okay to work with Justine and ultimately, her voice.

   - 3 audio files types were coded and provided through the use of [**Switch Audio File Converter Software**](https://www.nch.com.au/switch/index.html). An MP3, M4A and WAV files have been supplied.

   - There is also a written personal message to accompany this this.
   
   - The company logo spiral heart at the top LH corner of the navbar is an active link to index.html and reloads the landing/welcome page.
   

2. #### Get to know me page

   - Scrollspy from Bootstrap was employed and the nav link can take the user to any section.
   
   - The user is greeted by a small message from Justine which aims to supply the idea of the section in a personal manner.
   
   - A second and slightly longer recording of Justine is presented. This allows the user to hear Justine's own personal story and how she came to become a Hypnotherapist. Again, this is to show
   and encourage Justine's openness towards a potential user and build trust. Identification of her story with that of the user is a key feature here.

   - Personal messages then follow this recording.
   
   - An important section follows and provides the user to actually hear a testimonial rather than simply read one. A written format is also provided in the modal that accompanies Anne-Sophie's 
   powerful verbal recording.

3. #### Let's explore page

   - It was noted that the subject of Hypnotherapy has a lot of academic research and text, and rightly so. However, the question was considered, does the potential user/client want to read
   and engage with such text?

   - It was decided that Justine would provide several 'user-friendly' articles or questions and some statements that challenged and corrected normal and widely acknowledged misconceptions about
   Hypnotherapy.

   - To make this more interesting and interactive a Carousel format would follow Justines 'to the point' message. Photographs from [**Adobe Stock**](https://stock.adobe.com/uk/) and [**Unsplash**](https://unsplash.com/) were 
   used. The images choosen were shown and agreed with Justine. Those images that envoked emotions and captured the essence of the subject and the article were used. Evoking thought from this content
   was considered to be an important attribute.

   - Several images were used to pose those question that most user's would have. The answer was shown via the employment of modals from Bootstrap 4.

4. #### Connect & Work with me

   - The connect with me section provides several means/ways to connect with Justine if the user so wishes.
   
   - A direct messaging facility presented to the user. This would be aligned to deliver these messages directly to Justine's personal Hypnotherapy email. Form validation has been required
   using ```HTML5's``` new ```required``` class validator based upon browser specific alerts.

   - Justine's business mobile, Skype and email are then provided with icons being used from [**Font Awesome**](https://fontawesome.com/)
   
   - The user then glides to the 'Working with me' section. This was important as it shows and informs the user what to do next and helps guide them through what is a specific and exacting process
   used by Justine and Hypnotherapists in general. This hopefully installs confidence in the user and helps to reduce unknown quantities or answer questions they may have.

   - Colourful icons were choosen to reflect the nature of the information from Font Awesome.
   
5. #### Blog

   - It was concluded from Justine in the client discovery meeting that there is generally a lot of mis-directed information about the subject of Hypnotherapy. It was decided that a positive approach
   would be to include a personal blog from Justine. This will be on a monthly basis.

   - From a business perspective, this is a great way to offer an attractive and positive message as well as relate personal and first-hand experiences to the user.
   
   - The blog article is accessed from a button which opens a new tab for the user convenience.


### Features Left to Implement

Having built the JHCH site is has provided both Justine and I to consider future features. These include the following;

1. Live email/messaging system - It has been noted that this project and the actual live version does not yet have a fully-functioning direct messaging system. This will be directed towards the JHCH business email

2. Subscription service - This will allow a user to 'sign-up' for free emails/blogs/weekly messages from Justine. It will also allow Justine to build a potential client base for marketing and other purposes.

3. Calendly/Paypal/Zoom implementation - This is one of the main priporties moving forwards. The ability to link the calendly app to both Justine's Paypal and Zoom accounts will provide an easy and seemless service as 
well as reduce the need for administration or scheduling for Justine.

4. A responsive menu-icon to appear for the user on all responsive sizes that can be accessed when the user wants or needs this.

The above future features 1-3. have been planned to be implemented by the end of July 2019 at the latest.

5. A paid subscription service and member's area - Once an adequate social media following and newsletter/blog subscription base has been attained, a monthly-paid-subscription service will 
be offered. This will be a specific area where a user has login details. From this area a number of insightful resources will be offered, personal videos from Justine on many differing areas to do with Hypnotherapy and
specific phobias. Downloadable self-hypnosis recordings and scripts that the user can use. Other forms of therapy will be offered from Justine such as Holistic nutrition, Yoga therapy, bespoke clothing ranges and a future
'The JH Academy of Holistic Well-Being'. The plans for this are being compiled now. These features are planned to commence in 2020.

## Testing

1. Using google developer tools I firstly ensured that the layout and function was correct on all screen sizes ranging from the equivalent of a Samsung Galaxy 5 mobile telephone to a desktop.
2. For each screen size I then checked that the following links and functions operated as they were intended for all responsive screen sizes as defined by Bootstrap;

   - All Navbar links including scrollspy and the company logo to reload the landing/welcome web page
   - All 4 audio file functions/buttons (For all 3 audio files)
   - All modals launched correctly and displayed the appropriate and correct content
   - Ensured the responsive validatory fucntions operated correctly on the personal message form (Connect with me section)
   - All footer links work correctly

3. That the blog article launched within a new tab and was correctly displayed for all responsive screen sizes.


## Deployment

The project was built using [Cloud9](https://c9.io), through a built-in function called 'Git', I could commit
the project & push it up to [GitHub](https://github.com/).

- To view the deployed version of [Simon Game!](https://github.com/Peggy535/jhch-project) I needed to take the following steps:
