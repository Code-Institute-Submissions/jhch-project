            <p>Something a majority of us take for granted is the ease of flying to various destinations throughout the world. Be it for that one big family Annual Holiday, visiting loved ones who live abroad or those work commitments, even just for the shear
               exhilaration of exploring new places. Many of us think nothing of walking onto a plane with no fear or anxiety at all. We look forward to take off and a chance to catch up on a good book, new film we’ve been itching to watch in peace or just
               catch up on some sleep and an excuse to do nothing and relax. Perfect... right? <br><br> There is however, another group of people, individuals who with even just the thought of flying can cause stress and anxiety, this happens for different
               reasons for each individual and it’s usually not something they address until each time they are due to board a flight. Struggling with how they should deal with such a phobia and sometimes dealing with a phobia that seems to have developed
               over night.<br><br> The experience for some during flights can cause different emotional reactions and the main culprit is of-course FEAR, which in turn causes extreme cases of panic, so much so that any unexpected bumps or turbulence for
               any length of time during the flight can have a grown adult reduced to tears of fear, fear of lose not only of themselves and of the plane crashing but also the lose of family and friends and never seeing them again.<br><br> I recently worked
               with a young lady who had an extreme fear of flying, extreme to anyone who excitedly steps on a flight that is, and takes the experience for granted as an exciting and comfortable one. This lovely client is a positive, well rounded and very
               intelligent young lady, has been well travelled since infancy and someone who you just wouldn’t imagine would have picked up such a fear, but from her late teenage years changes happened and this in turn brought on a fear that hadn’t been
               heightened before.<br><br> So where do they go to for help....<br><br> Some go to therapy, others unfortunately ignore the problem until they have to face it once more, and go through the whole unpleasant experience again.
               <br><br> Luckily, there are also those who seek out curative hypnotherapy with registered therapists like myself and change what has in the past been a very distressing experience into a very comfortable and joyful experience.<br><br> Back
               to my lovely young client...<br><br> I had less than a week when I was approached to work with this particular client, longer term success usually comes from more time (averagely, one week) between the initial consultation and actual session,
               in order for the fact finding information the therapist requires, from the very words of the client, chosen carefully for suggestibility when working with the subconscious mind during the main body of work during the session. And also time
               to work on positive imagery between the initial meeting and the actual hypnosis session for the client. I had just two days to prepare a well suited script for a successful outcome. The first-session was a success and we decided on a follow
               up session for the evening before flying just to check in with how she was still feeling before taking the flight. This was just three days later, this time the session was slightly shorter than the first but the main suggestion was repeated
               and improved on. Using the scale of one to ten... one being the most relaxed and ten being the most fearful, my client had changed to a scale of 2/3 from what had been 7/8, so a very positive outcome.<br><br> My confidence and excitement as
               the hypnotherapist throughout the whole experience never wavered, I was very confident that we would be successful in making my clients next flight the best and most comfortable experience to date. The confidence in your hypnotherapist is
               paramount, and thankfully my client could see the confidence I had in her potential and a successful outcome.<br><br> Fast forward to the morning of my clients touch down and arrival into the airport. All I could here was the joy and pride
               from the voicemail I received directly after my client landing, ecstatic and very proud of her achievement, she had had a very comfortable flight, managed to sleep peacefully and even though there was a little turbulence, it didn’t send her
               into panic, or floods of tears and imagining the worst. 100% success rate!<br><br> So, if you’re indeed a sceptic just dropping in for a nose, or someone who wants to know more because you too might be looking for help with something in your
               life. You can’t help but get to this point in this blog and now at least think, there’s something in this whole curative hypnotherapy thing! Right?<br><br> I could go into great depth on the subconscious mind and how this changed this whole
               experience around for my client, but I will save that for a separate blog. Or you can explore more while you’re here on my website, which I encourage hugely.<br><br> The contact page is pretty useful for any enquires that you feel haven’t
               been answered on my website. Feel free to connect with me, I would love to help.<br><br> Justine x<br>
